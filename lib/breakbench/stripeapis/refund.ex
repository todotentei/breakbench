  When you create a new refund, you must specify a charge on which to create it.

  Creating a new refund will refund a charge that has previously been created
  but not yet refunded. Funds will be refunded to the credit or debit card that
  was originally charged.

  You can optionally refund only part of a charge. You can do so multiple times,
  until the entire charge has been refunded.

  Once entirely refunded, a charge can't be refunded again. This method will
  return an error when called on an already-refunded charge, or when trying to
  refund more money than is left on a charge.
